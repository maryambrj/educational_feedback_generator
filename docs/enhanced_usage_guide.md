# Enhanced AI Grader with Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency

This enhanced version of the AI grader incorporates **Chain-of-Thought reasoning** and **Self-Consistency** to provide more reliable and transparent grading.

## 🧠 Key Improvements

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- The LLM follows a structured 6-step reasoning process for each grading decision
- Provides transparent thinking steps: Analysis → Criterion Evaluation → Technical Assessment → Conceptual Understanding → Final Scoring → Feedback Generation
- Results in more thoughtful and justified grades

### Self-Consistency 
- Each problem is graded multiple times (default: 5 attempts)
- Final score is determined using consensus across attempts (median scoring)
- Confidence scores reflect agreement between attempts
- Reduces random variation and improves reliability

### Enhanced Transparency
- All individual grading attempts are saved for human review
- Detailed reasoning steps are preserved for each attempt
- Consistency analysis helps identify problematic rubrics or complex problems

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Enhanced Grading
```bash
python enhanced_ai_grader_cli.py grade notebooks/ hw2_california_housing
```

### Custom Parameters
```bash
# Use 7 attempts with higher temperature for more variation
python enhanced_ai_grader_cli.py grade notebooks/ hw2_california_housing --attempts 7 --temperature 0.8

# Don't save individual attempts (faster, less storage)
python enhanced_ai_grader_cli.py grade notebooks/ hw2_california_housing --no-save
```

### Analyze Saved Attempts
```bash
# Review consistency and identify problematic items
python enhanced_ai_grader_cli.py analyze-attempts
```

### Debug Configuration
```bash
python enhanced_ai_grader_cli.py debug-config
```

### Key Metrics Explained

#### Confidence Scores
- **0.8-1.0**: High confidence - consistent grading across attempts
- **0.7-0.8**: Medium confidence - some variation but acceptable
- **0.0-0.7**: Low confidence - high variation, flagged for review

#### Reasoning Quality Ratings
- **Excellent**: High confidence + detailed feedback + thorough analysis
- **Good**: Solid reasoning with minor gaps
- **Fair**: Basic reasoning, may lack depth
- **Poor**: Inconsistent or minimal reasoning

#### Consistency Ratings
- **Excellent**: Low score variance (≤1.0) + high confidence (≥0.8)
- **Good**: Moderate variance (≤2.0) + good confidence (≥0.7)
- **Fair**: Higher variance (≤3.0) + acceptable confidence (≥0.6)
- **Poor**: High variance or low confidence

## 🔍 Reviewing Grading Quality

### 1. Check the Enhanced HTML Report
- Open `enhanced_grading_report.html` for a comprehensive overview
- Review reasoning quality distribution
- Identify students flagged for review

### 2. Examine Consistency Analysis
```bash
# Open the consistency analysis CSV
enhanced_ai_grading_results/consistency_analysis.csv
```
Look for:
- High score variance (>3.0) - indicates problematic rubrics or complex problems
- Low confidence scores (<0.7) - may need manual review
- Consistency rating of "Poor" - definitely needs attention

### 3. Review Individual Attempts
```bash
# Analyze saved attempts for insights
python enhanced_ai_grader_cli.py analyze-attempts

# Manually review specific attempt files
ls grading_attempts/
```

Each attempt file contains:
- Metadata about the problem and student
- Full Chain-of-Thought reasoning for each attempt
- Parsed results including confidence scores
- Raw LLM responses for complete transparency

### 4. Read Detailed Feedback
Enhanced feedback files include:
- AI reasoning summary
- Key strengths and weaknesses identified
- Step-by-step thinking process
- Confidence assessment

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Number of Attempts
```bash
# More attempts = higher reliability but slower grading
--attempts 3   # Faster, good for testing
--attempts 5   # Default, good balance
--attempts 10  # Maximum reliability, slower
```

### Temperature Setting
```bash
# Lower temperature = more consistent but potentially rigid
--temperature 0.3  # Very consistent, less creative
--temperature 0.7  # Default, good balance
--temperature 1.0  # More variation, more creative
```

### Storage Options
```bash
# Save all attempts (default)
python enhanced_ai_grader_cli.py grade notebooks/ assignment

# Skip saving attempts (faster, less storage)
python enhanced_ai_grader_cli.py grade notebooks/ assignment --no-save
```

## 🚩 When to Use Manual Review

The system automatically flags problems for manual review when:

### Automatic Flagging Conditions
- **Low Confidence**: Final confidence < 0.7
- **High Score Variance**: Standard deviation > 15% of total points
- **Score Issues**: Total score exceeds maximum possible
- **Poor Reasoning Quality**: Minimal or inconsistent reasoning

### Manual Review Priorities
1. **High Priority**: Very low confidence (<0.5) or score exceeds maximum
2. **Medium Priority**: Moderate confidence issues or poor reasoning quality
3. **Low Priority**: Minor consistency issues

### Review Process
1. Check the `flagged_for_review.csv` file
2. Examine individual attempt files for flagged problems
3. Review the reasoning steps to understand AI thinking

## 🔍 Advanced Analysis Examples

### Finding Problematic Rubric Items
```bash
# Check for high variance across multiple students
grep "Score Variance" enhanced_ai_grading_results/consistency_analysis.csv | sort -k3 -nr

# Look for patterns in flagged items
cut -d',' -f2,6 enhanced_ai_grading_results/flagged_for_review.csv | sort | uniq -c
```

### Identifying Grading Patterns
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load results
results = pd.read_csv('enhanced_ai_grading_results/enhanced_ai_grading_results.csv')

# Find problems with consistently low confidence
low_conf_problems = results[results['Confidence'] < 0.7]['Problem ID'].value_counts()

# Identify students with many flagged items
flagged_students = results[results['Flagged for Review'] == 'Yes']['Student Name'].value_counts()

print("Problems needing rubric review:", low_conf_problems.head())
print("Students needing extra attention:", flagged_students.head())
```

### Reasoning Quality Analysis
```bash
# Generate reasoning quality distribution
python -c "
import pandas as pd
results = pd.read_csv('enhanced_ai_grading_results/enhanced_ai_grading_results.csv')
quality_dist = results['Reasoning Quality'].value_counts()
print('Reasoning Quality Distribution:')
for quality, count in quality_dist.items():
    print(f'{quality}: {count} ({count/len(results)*100:.1f}%)')
"
```

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Modifying the Chain-of-Thought Process

You can customize the reasoning steps by editing `enhanced_llm_grader.py`:

```python
# Add custom reasoning steps
step_patterns = [
    "STEP 1 - INITIAL ANALYSIS:",
    "STEP 2 - CRITERION EVALUATION:",
    "STEP 3 - TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT:",
    "STEP 4 - CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING:",
    "STEP 5 - FINAL SCORING:",
    "STEP 6 - FEEDBACK:",
    "STEP 7 - CUSTOM DOMAIN ANALYSIS:",  # Add your own step
]
```

### Adjusting Consensus Methods

Modify the self-consistency algorithm in `_apply_self_consistency()`:

```python
# Use mean instead of median for score consensus
consensus_scores[criterion.name] = statistics.mean(scores)

# Use weighted average based on confidence
weights = [attempt['confidence'] for attempt in valid_attempts]
consensus_scores[criterion.name] = weighted_average(scores, weights)
```

### Custom Flagging Criteria

Add domain-specific flagging rules:

```python
# Flag based on custom criteria
custom_flagged = (
    final_confidence < 0.6 or 
    score_std > rubric.total_points * 0.20 or
    consensus_total < rubric.total_points * 0.3  # Very low scores
)
```
